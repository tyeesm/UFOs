# UFOs

# Overview of Project

In this module, we were introduced to JavaScript and it's updates.  According to the module, JavaScript was developed in 1995 and has gone through some major updates.  In 2015, JavaScript underwent its sixth update, including updates to the syntax.  This major update commonly refer to as ES6, ES6+, ES2015, OR ECMAScript 2015 and was very well received by the programming community because it made it easier to read and write code. 

For this module, we were tasked with helping Dana.  Dana is a data journalist and wanted to write about her town called McMinnville in Oregon and its UFO sightings.  Since Dana decided to create a UFO website for UFO enthusiasts, dynamic content was created with JavaScript.  First, a table was created using the sighting information data stored in the JavaScipt array. Second, filters were set-up for user input. Finally, the table was placed in a HTML file for easy viewing. 

## *Purpose*
Create a dynamic table using JavaScript and embed it into HTML
# Results
The HTML actually rendered well, with the banner picture, correctly formatted table, colors and fonts of text in the appropriate position.  However, there is something preventing the dynamic table from loading in the rendered HTML index, pictured below.

# Summary
The idea of having dynamic tables (and other dynamic elements) seems like an important aspect to data science, in that it makes delivery of insights far more useful. Instead of sending a collaborator or client a static png plot, csv, or PDF report, a dynamic solution like the one implemented here in JS would be a worthwhile alternative.  However, this exact implementation is not ideal.  Troubleshooting JS, even the newest version, is somewhat unclear compared to python, especially when combined with CSS, HTML, and other web languages.  It would be nice to see a python wrapper for these sort of JS tools so users could have a better interface to these sort of tools.
